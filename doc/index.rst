**A high-level plotting API for the PyData ecosystem built on HoloViews.**


Installation
============

Step 1: Install a `Miniconda <http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html>`_  (or `Anaconda <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`_) environment

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Any Linux, Mac OS X, or Windows computer with a web browser (preferably Google Chrome) should be suitable. 16GB of RAM is required for some of the examples, but most will run fine in 4GB.

If you don't already have conda on your machine, you can get it from `Anaconda.com <http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html>`_, and then open a terminal window.
